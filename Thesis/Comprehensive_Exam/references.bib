An equation is developed for calculating lattice energies, using the most readily available experimental data; the results are at least as reliable as those from other methods of calculation. The use of the Born-Haber values as a test of the accuracy of such calculations is examined, with reference to the probable errors of values of electron affinity. It is shown that lattice energies may be obtained from solubility data, if the relevant enthalpies of hydration are known.},

	abstract = { The deviations from the equation of state for perfect gases which are observed in all known gases result from the interactions of their constituent atoms or molecules. The excess pressures observed at all but the lowest temperatures show that the dominating factor is the strong repulsion between atoms at close renge, due to the interpentration of complete electron shells. Little is known about these repulsions, and that is readily summarized. Between atoms with spherically symmetrical distributions it is likely that the repulsive potential is accurately represented by a function P(r)e-r/p, (1) Where r is separation of the atomic nuclei and P(r) a polynomial in r. Quantum theoretical calculations made by Slater (1928) for helium atoms (with a closed shell of two electrons) and by Bleick and Mayer (1934) for neon atoms (with a closed shell of eight electrons) show that an adequate expression may sometimes be obtained if the polynomial is replaced by a constant. Some confirmation of this (though over a very restricted range of r) is given by Born and Mayer (1932) and Huggins (1937), whose work on ionic cubic crystals shows that their elastic properties are admirably correlated when the repulsive potential of two ions of rare gas type is represented by an exponential function be-r/p, with a range of about one atomic diameter. }

In addition, the evolution of non-empirical and semi-empirical density functional design is reviewed, and guidelines are provided for the proper and effective use of density functionals. The most promising functional considered is $\omega$B97M-V, a range-separated hybrid meta-GGA with VV10 nonlocal correlation, designed using a combinatorial approach.

	abstract = {Abstract It is shown by an extensive benchmark on molecular energy data that the mathematical form of the damping function in DFT-D methods has only a minor impact on the quality of the results. For 12 different functionals, a standard “zero-damping” formula and rational damping to finite values for small interatomic distances according to Becke and Johnson (BJ-damping) has been tested. The same (DFT-D3) scheme for the computation of the dispersion coefficients is used. The BJ-damping requires one fit parameter more for each functional (three instead of two) but has the advantage of avoiding repulsive interatomic forces at shorter distances. With BJ-damping better results for nonbonded distances and more clear effects of intramolecular dispersion in four representative molecular structures are found. For the noncovalently-bonded structures in the S22 set, both schemes lead to very similar intermolecular distances. For noncovalent interaction energies BJ-damping performs slightly better but both variants can be recommended in general. The exception to this is Hartree-Fock that can be recommended only in the BJ-variant and which is then close to the accuracy of corrected GGAs for non-covalent interactions. According to the thermodynamic benchmarks BJ-damping is more accurate especially for medium-range electron correlation problems and only small and practically insignificant double-counting effects are observed. It seems to provide a physically correct short-range behavior of correlation/dispersion even with unmodified standard functionals. In any case, the differences between the two methods are much smaller than the overall dispersion effect and often also smaller than the influence of the underlying density functional. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

These phase changes are the result of atomistic events driven by thermal fluctuations. The occurrence of atomistic level events with the length scales on the order of 10–10 m and time scales of 10–13 S equivalent to the vibrational frequency of atoms makes the nucleation a very complicated phenomenon to study. Even though abundant literature is available about fundamental aspects of nucleation, the knowledge on these phenomena is far from complete.

	abstract = {Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are employed to investigate crystal nucleation and growth in oversaturated aqueous LiF solutions. Results obtained for a range of temperatures provide evidence that the rate of crystal growth is determined by a substantial energy barrier (∼49 kJ mol−1) related to the loss of water from the ion hydration shells. Employing direct MD simulations, we do not observe spontaneous nucleation of LiF crystals at 300 K, but nucleation is easily observable in NVT simulations at 500 K. This contrasts with the NaCl case, where crystal nucleation is directly observed in similar simulations at 300 K. Based on these observations, together with a detailed analysis of ion clustering in metastable LiF solutions, we argue that the ion dehydration barrier also plays a key role in crystal nucleation. The hydration of the relatively small Li+ and F− ions strongly influences the probability of forming large, crystal-like ion clusters, which are a necessary precursor to nucleation.

	abstract = {The Born model of ionic solids is shown to permit the complete determination from solid-state data of crystal radii for the alkali and halogen ions in the individual alkali halides with the NaCl structure, which are directly comparable with the experimental crystal radii deducible from the X-ray maps for the electron distribution in the crystal. The determination is based on the direct relationships which are established, by a physical interpretation of the observed approximate additivity of the interionic distance, between the crystal radii and the parameters entering plausible expressions for the first and second neighbor contributions to the Born repulsive energy. Two different forms of the repulsive energy are considered : the Huggins-Mayer form, having an exponential dependence on the ionic distance with a hardness parameter common to the family of salts, and the Pauling form, having an inverse-power dependence on the ionic distance, again with a common hardness parameter. The parameters for these forms are determined from solid-state data by a Huggins-type procedure. The crystal radii of the alkali and halogen ions in the NaCl structure obtained with the Huggins-Mayer form are, respectively, larger and smaller than the traditional crystal radii by about two-tenths of an angstrom. Their uncertainty is estimated to be about 0.05 {\AA} by comparison with the crystal radii obtained with the Pauling form. The crystal radii of the ions in NaCl and LiF agree rather closely with those deduced from the X-ray maps of the electron distribution available for these crystals. The value of the determination of electron maps for other alkali halide crystals is emphasized, to test in particular the significance of the small regular variations of the crystal radius of an ion from crystal to crystal suggested by the calculations. The applicability of the Born model procedure for the determination of crystal radii to other families of ionic solids is pointed out.},

The M06 functional is parametrized including both transition metals and nonmetals, whereas the M06-2X functional is a high-nonlocality functional with double the amount of nonlocal exchange (2X), and it is parametrized only for nonmetals.The functionals, along with the previously published M06-L local functional and the M06-HF full-Hartree--Fock functionals, constitute the M06 suite of complementary functionals. We assess these four functionals by comparing their performance to that of 12 other functionals and Hartree--Fock theory for 403 energetic data in 29 diverse databases, including ten databases for thermochemistry, four databases for kinetics, eight databases for noncovalent interactions, three databases for transition metal bonding, one database for metal atom excitation energies, and three databases for molecular excitation energies. We also illustrate the performance of these 17 methods for three databases containing 40 bond lengths and for databases containing 38 vibrational frequencies and 15 vibrational zero point energies. We recommend the M06-2X functional for applications involving main-group thermochemistry, kinetics, noncovalent interactions, and electronic excitation energies to valence and Rydberg states. We recommend the M06 functional for application in organometallic and inorganometallic chemistry and for noncovalent interactions.",

	abstract = {Molecular dynamics simulations are used to investigate the factors that influence the nucleation of NaCl crystals in a supersaturated aqueous solution. We describe a methodology for detecting solidlike NaCl clusters (potential nuclei) and following their evolution in time until they achieve nucleation (which is very rare) or dissolve back into solution. Through an analysis of cluster lifetimes and multiple nucleation events, we demonstrate that cluster size is not the only property that influences cluster stability and the probability of achieving nucleation. We introduce a parameter called cluster crystallinity, which is a measure of the solidlike order in a particular cluster. We show that cluster order (as measured by this parameter) has a strong influence on the lifetime and nucleation probability of clusters of equal sizes, with the lifetime and probability of nucleation increasing with increasing crystallinity. These observations remain true for clusters as small as six ions, showing that the struct...},
